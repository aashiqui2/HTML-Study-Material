        A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.
        Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.
        A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab.
    -->
    <!--
        To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your 
        webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image 
        in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".
        ->you can name this image anything
    
    -> Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:
    -->
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="./img/earth.jpg"> 
    <!-- here type="image/x-icon" is optional -->
